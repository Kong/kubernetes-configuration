# kubernetes-configuration

This repository holds the API definitions for Kong's Kubernetes configuration.

> ðŸ‘· ðŸš§ This is currently a work in progress which is heavily based on [Kong's Ingress Controller][kic] CRDs
> Before KIC starts using these CRDs this repo should contain only additive,
> non-breaking changes on top of KIC's types.
